# :herb: rosalind-problems :hibiscus:

A repository to contain my attempts at problems from http://rosalind.info 

[ROSALIND](http://rosalind.info) is a platform for learning bioinformatics and programming through problem solving.

I thought it would be interesting to find out more about bioinformatics and try to learn some key concepts to see if I am interested. I enjoyed studying biology at A level, so it would be interesting to explore the intersection of biology and computer science through this field. I will code solutions to the problems in Python, to keep my skills sharp.
